- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
I did with Olohi.

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
I attended office hours of professor Jordan on Tuesday and office hours of professor Johanna. I also want to TA on sunday and wednesday nights.

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
The importance of being specific on everything and not assuming that Java will figure out. The syntax is similar to python but somehow different.

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
The main difference is that in java you can not call function only but you need to make sure it is actually part of class.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Giving myslef time to understand what I need to do and how to do it worked for me. Trying to do everything by myself did not work. My advice to anyone taking this course, make sure to use the resources avaliable to you and ask for help your classmates, professors and TA.
